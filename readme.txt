The basic scheme of this tutorial, and all the files with the 'Swarm_original' 
prefix in their name, are coming from the tutorial originally distributed by the
Swarm Development Group via the swarmapps file (last version, referred here,
is swarmapps-objc-2.2-3.tar.gz).

Those file are unmodified, but the correction of a few typos.

We can find them on line at
