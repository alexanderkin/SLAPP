Here we have both a tutorial and an agent-based simulation shell,
coming from Swarm (www.swarm.org) and named SLAPP, for Swarm-Like Agent
Protocol in Python.

You can find SLAPP as an Agent-based Model (ABM) shell in the folder # 6.

The basic scheme of the tutorial and all the files - with the "Swarm_original"
prefix in their names - are coming from the tutorial originally distributed by the
Swarm Development Group via the swarmapps file (last version, referred here,
is swarmapps-objc-2.2-3.tar.gz).

Those files are unmodified, but the correction of a few typos.

We can find them on line at
