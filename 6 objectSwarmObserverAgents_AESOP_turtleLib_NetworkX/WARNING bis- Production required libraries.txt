To run the ‘production’ application it is necessary to install

Matplotlib which is at http://matplotlib.org

and

NetworkX, which is at http://networkx.github.io


Matplotlib 1.4.0 to 1.4.2 in MacOS produces an error when we search to display the labels of the NetworkX graph (anything is working with v.1.3.1)
