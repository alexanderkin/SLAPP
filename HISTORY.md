0.92 Introduced in folder 6, file start.py, a *debug* common variable; if set to True, a large part of the try/except structures will be bypassed, so the errors will be managed directly by the Python interpreter;  this choice can be useful when you build a new project and as an expert user you want to check the errors in a basic way
