SLAPP, as Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, has in folder # 6,
“6 objectSwarmObserverAgents_AESOP_turtleLib_NetworkX”, its full implementation.

You can use it as an agent-based shell, keeping unmodified the basic part contained
into the $$slapp$$ folder.

Install the required libraries (as explained in the two Warning files
into that folder), then run

python start.py

and chose one of the three project examples:

basic

school

production

(Look at README.md in this folder, for a graphical presentation.)

There is also a 'debug' project: have a look the the Reference Manual.
