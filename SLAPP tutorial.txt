		SIMPLEBUG SLAPP TUTORIAL


SLAPP = Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, by Pietro Terna

Swarm  = www.swarm.org
Python = www.python.org

This tutorial introduces the user through the development of a SLAPP
model that makes use of a lot of the functionalities of Swarm.

The model is related to the movement of a bug, randomly walking in a 2D space.

We start introducing a very simple, essentially plain program, about
a bug taking a random walk. Through a progression of models,
we introduce basic object-oriented and Swarm style programming.

Although this is a quite simple exercise, it shows how
easy it is to compose fairly complex software from simple
building blocks.

In this folder we have several subfolders, each with a complete
application and a README file that helps you to walk through the code.

You should start with the "1 plainProgrammingBug" folder, and then
proceed in the following order (the start files can be found in the folders with
the same number):

1 plainProgrammingBug
2 basicObjectProgrammingBug
3 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs
4 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs_bugExternal_+_shuffle
5 objectSwarmModelBugs
6 objectSwarmObserverAgents_AESOP_turtleLib_NetworkX
