		SIMPLEBUG SLAPP TUTORIAL


SLAPP = Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, by Pietro Terna

Swarm  = www.swarm.org 
Python = www.python.org

This tutorial takes the user through the development of a SLAPP
model that makes use of a lot of the functionality of Swarm.

The model consists of bugs taking random walks in a 2D space.

We start with a very simple, essentially plain program, for
a bug taking a random walk. Through a progression of models
we introduce basic object-oriented and swarm style programming.

Although this is a particularly simple exercise, it shows how 
easy it is to compose fairly complex software from simple
building blocks. 

In this directory we have several subdirectories, each with a complete
application and a README file that walks you through the code.

You should start with the "start 1 plainProgrammingBug" application, and then
proceed in the following order (the start files can be found in the folders with 
the same number):

start 1 plainProgrammingBug
start 2 basicObjectProgrammingBug
start 3 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs
start 4 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs_bugExternal_+_shuffle
start 5 objectSwarmModelBugs
start 6 objectSwarmObserverBugs_AESOP_turtleLib
start 7 objectSwarmObserverTkBugs (in '7 toBeDeveloped objectSwarmObserverTkBugs')
start 7b Tk test (in '7b toBeDeveloped Tk test')

7 and 7b are presently under development.
