		SIMPLEBUG SLAPP TUTORIAL


SLAPP = Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, by Pietro Terna

Swarm  = www.swarm.org 
Python = www.python.org

This tutorial introduces the user through the development of a SLAPP
model that makes use of a lot of the functionality of Swarm.

The model consists of bug random walking in a 2D space.

We start with a very simple, essentially plain program, about
a bug taking a random walk. Through a progression of models,
we introduce basic object-oriented and Swarm style programming.

Although this is a quite simple exercise, it shows how 
easy it is to compose fairly complex software from simple
building blocks. 

In this directory we have several subdirectories, each with a complete
application and a README file that walks you through the code.

You should start with the "1 plainProgrammingBug" folder, and then
proceed in the following order (the start files can be found in the folders with 
the same number):

1 plainProgrammingBug
2 basicObjectProgrammingBug
3 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs
4 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs_bugExternal_+_shuffle
